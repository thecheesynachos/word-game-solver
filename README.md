## Wordle Solver

Video on it: https://youtu.be/B2AVF3_qdHY

Simple logic for a Wordle solver. Only runs on Jupyter notebook at the moment, with no plans to make it a proper UI (anyone else is welcome to though).

I included list of 5-letter words I used. The original list of Scrabble words I used came from https://github.com/raun/Scrabble/blob/master/words.txt
